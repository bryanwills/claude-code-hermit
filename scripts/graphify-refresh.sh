# Refresh the root graph plus one graph per plugin. AST-only, no API key needed.
# Root answers cross-plugin questions; each plugin graph answers questions scoped
# to that plugin, where the root graph loses the answer to test-harness noise.
# Safe to call unconditionally from release skills: skips silently if graphify
# isn't installed, and a single plugin's failure warns and continues rather
# than aborting the rest — a stale graph must never block a release.
